# Icons

This directory should contain icon files for the extension.

## Required Icons:

- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for Firefox add-ons manager)
- `icon-96.png` - 96x96 pixels (for high-DPI displays)

## Creating Icons:

You can create simple bee-themed icons using any image editor. Suggested design:
- Yellow/black color scheme (representing a bee)
- Simple hexagon or bee icon
- Clear and recognizable at small sizes

You can use free tools like:
- Canva (https://www.canva.com/)
- GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/)
- Or generate with AI tools

For now, the extension will work without icons, but they're recommended for a professional appearance.
